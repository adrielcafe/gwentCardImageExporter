The Gwent Card Image Exporter is an application written in Python using Tkinter. It can export both a .json file for gwent card data as well as directly export card art from the Unity game files. Card images can be generated all at once, in batches or individually. Cards can be exported with borders, strength/icons, provisons or just as the plain card art. A valid Gwent installtion on either Steam or GOG is required.

The code for GwentUtils and some the json generating is based on this repository: https://github.com/GwentCommunityDevelopers/gwent-data

Assets for card icons and borders can also be found in the 'assets' folder.
